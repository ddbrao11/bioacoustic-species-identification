# birdclef-species-identification-from-audio
Species identification from audio, focused on birds, amphibians, mammals and insects. Supports biodiversity monitoring through machine learning.

## Research Notes
This repository represents ongoing independent research exploration.

## Research Overview
This project investigates deep learning approaches for
bioacoustic species identification using environmental
audio recordings.

The work explores multimodal AI applications for
ecological monitoring and biodiversity analysis.

## Research Motivation
Automated biodiversity monitoring enables scalable
environmental research and conservation efforts.

## Research Questions
- Can audio models reliably identify species in noisy environments?
- Which representations capture ecological acoustic patterns?
- How can models generalize across habitats?

## Approach
Spectrogram feature extraction and classification models
evaluated on publicly available ecological datasets.

## Limitations
Environmental noise and class imbalance impact performance.
Geographic generalization remains challenging.
